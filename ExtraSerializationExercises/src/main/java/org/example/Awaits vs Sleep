What is the output of the program below? Explain your answer.

The output of the program is 0. Because on sleep, the program becomes not runnable
for 1000 miliseconds and does not execute the ThreadB. Therefore, leaving the
output to be it's initial value which is 0.


Also, would the answer change if we were to replace: sleep(1000); with b.wait();? Why or why not?
Yes, because sleep(1000); makes the main thread sleep for 1000 milliseconds,
giving some time for ThreadB to complete its loop and update the total variable.
