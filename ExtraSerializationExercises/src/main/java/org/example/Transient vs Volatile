Volatile Variable:

 A volatile variable is a variable that can be modified by multiple threads or processes simultaneously.
 Its used when you want to make sure that any changes to the variable are immediately visible to other threads or processes.
 Volatile variables are often used in multithreaded programming to ensure proper communication between different threads


Transient Variable:

A transient variable is typically used in the context of object serialization, which is the process of converting an object into a byte stream.
Transient variables are not included in the serialized form of the object. When an object is deserialized, transient variables are initialized with their default values.
They are used when there are certain variables in an object that should not be persisted or saved during the serialization process.
